Strong families don’t happen by accident. Scripture places the responsibility of leadership squarely on men — not as tyrants, but as servants.

When men lead with humility, courage, and faith, families flourish. This leadership starts at home long before it ever reaches the church or the nation.

> _“But as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.” — Joshua 24:15_

This is why the mission of Men of God begins with equipping men to lead their families well.
