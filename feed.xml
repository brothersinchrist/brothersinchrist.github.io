<p>The apostle Peter is reminding us that God has forgiven us of much sin and to use our newfound faith in Christ for the building up of the church and for the glory of God.</p>

<p>Brothers it is of the upmost importance that we are committed to being faithful before God at all times with the understanding that he knows all things and his Grace abides(remains). We have all had moment where the stressors of life and lust of the flesh bring us to a crossroads where we (Men of God) must  choose to trust and obey that he knows what he (God) is doing and what’s best for us. We have and will continue to experience hard times like sickness, sometimes frustrating moments at work with a difficult coworker or Boss or even at home in the place that you would hope to feel the safest from the presents of sin and spiritual conflict.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.”</em></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>-–John‬ ‭16‬:‭33‬ ‭NIV‬‬</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>We have been called out from the world to live for God and his glory so let’s get our house in order. We don’t have to suffer in silence. We have the Holy Spirit. We have Gods word and we have each other.</p>

<p>Galatians(6:2)</p>

<p>James (5:14-16)</p>

<p>The Lord is doing a work in our hearts and in his perfect timing we his (children) will see the goodness of our God if done despair or conformed to this world.</p>

<p>Philippians(1:6)</p>

<p>Romans(12:2)</p>

He said to him, “Abraham!” “Here I am,” he replied. Then God said, “Take your son, your only son, whom you love—Isaac—and go to the region of Moriah. Sacrifice him there as a burnt offering on a mountain I will show you.””</p>

<p>Genesis 22:1-2 NIV</p>

<p>I know, I know, we’ve all heard the story a thousand times. But stop and think about how this could have felt. How close to God must you be to know, without doubt, it is He Who said you must do this?  God does test us. Not through temptations, but through commands that challenge us. I’ve heard sermons, read other books and saw movies about how this played out, but no one knows any more than what is said here in The Word. Abraham immediately did what God commanded. And, without God stopping him at the last second, would have sacrificed Isaac. No, he wasn’t perfect, but Abraham’s faith was amazing. That’s the main thing we need to remember from this story. We must have faith that God will do what He has promised, no matter what else happens, what He has to overcome or how far He has to go. God is true and belief in that, no matter what, is the faith He requires.</p>]]></content><author><name>Bible </name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[“Some time later God tested Abraham.
