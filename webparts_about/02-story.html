<p>We’re two men from two different worlds — different careers, different upbringings — yet God brought our families together and made us brothers.</p>

<p>One of us spent 24 years traveling the world in the United States Air Force.<br />
The other has lived his entire life in Georgia, working hard, raising a family, and serving faithfully in his church.</p>

<p>Our families are united.<br />
Our values are united.<br />
Our mission is united.</p>

<p>We’re here to encourage men to lead boldly, love deeply, and walk in the strength God provides.</p>
